Match 3 games are simple puzzle games where the player is asked to pair three or more identical items on a tiled game board. Popular modern variations include Candy Crush and Bejeweled. Unity is ideally suited to this kind of game design, and it's a great entry point to more complex kinds of game development.

In this project we cover topics like creating a grid-based game board, using inheritance to create different types of game pieces, adding obstacles and new levels, detecting matches and clearing pieces, and implementing a user interface complete with a score screen.
